			 	Welcome to the park... No, Jurassic Bot is not related to Jurassic Park &trade; in any way apart from the name &#129313;
			 	<br>
			 	<br>
				Jurassic Bot is an economy discord bot featuring a range of commands, and packed with customizability. To get started, visit <a href="commands.html" class="link">commands</a> and and try some out some commands for yourself!
				<br>
				<br>
				You play as a dinosaur where you can hunt, eat and my favorite yet, sleep. You can gain currency in the form of DNA and use it to purchase better, bigger, faster and stronger dinosaurs. You can also use in game money to purchase colors and personalise your features. There are 4 body parts which you can set the colors of individually of each other, and view whenever you eat, fight, view your statistics etc.
				<br>
				<br>
				You can request to fight somebody using the command !fight. They have 3 minutes to accept your fight request, if they choose to decline you will automatically start attacking their den. Your den is like a base, it’s where you sleep and take refuge when a predator that’s too fast to outrun tries to fight you. You can use the command !hibernate [time] (or !sleep [time] if you’re lazy) and nobody will be able to attack you. You can’t harm what you can’t see.
				<br>
				<br>
				If you want to customize your dinosaur, you can use the command <i style="font-size: 20px;">!customize [main color] [underbelly color] [pattern color] [eye color]</i>. If you want to view what your or any other dinosaur would look like with a certain skin pattern before buying the colors or changing the color, you can use <i style="font-size: 20px;">!view [dinosaur] [main color] [underbelly color] [pattern color] [eye color]</i>
