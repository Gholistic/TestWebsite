				 For enquiries and bot ideas feel free to contact me @RyAn#2110 on discord or email rjskent@gmail.com 
				 <br><!--this breaks the text, similarly to pressing the enter key in a text document-->
				 <br>
				In order to invite the bot you will need to click this
				<a href="https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=575626393396707329&permissions=8&scope=bot" target="_blank" class="link">link</a>
				, select a server, accept the permissions and click add to server. It is to be noted that you may only invite the bot to servers you’re the owner or admin of.

				In terms of money, there are a few commands that can get you money. Although money is only used for buying colours, it can also be used to convert into things like food, dna and credits by using the !sell command. You buy new dinosaurs with DNA but you also can upgrade them using credits, which can be gained when you level up or purchased for a lot of money. You level up by fighting, and hunting. 
				<br>
				<br>
				If you don’t want to use ! in front of every command, you can use !prefix [new prefix]. Just know that only the owner of a server can use this command.
